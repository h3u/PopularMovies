# Popular Movies App

This app is an Udacity Nanodegree exercise that is build in two stages.
Up to now it hopefully covers the features for stage 1.


## Configuration

Add your personal api key for [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to
`local.properties` before running/building the app.

Please add following line:
`API_KEY="<MY_PERSONAL_API_KEY>"`


## known issues / todo / ideas

- add view/hint for missing network connection
- layout idea: change detail view to fill full background with backdrop image and put all elements in opacity views
- change layout to material blue grey or similar
- spinner to change sorting instead of setting activity or combination of both
- auto select first element of movie grid in 2 pane views after changing the sorting
- add encryption/hiding for api_key https://rammic.github.io/2015/07/28/hiding-secrets-in-android-apps/
